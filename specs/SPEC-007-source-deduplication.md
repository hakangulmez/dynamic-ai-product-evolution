# SPEC-007 — Source Deduplication

## Status

Draft

## Objective

Detect duplicate filings, mirrored PDFs, repeated product pages, and near-identical passages.

## Inputs

Normalized documents.

## Outputs

Duplicate clusters and canonical-source decisions.

## Governing documents

- `CLAUDE.md`
- `docs/SOURCE_POLICY.md`
- `docs/TEMPORAL_POLICY.md`
- relevant methodology document

## Core rules

- exact hashes
- near-duplicate similarity
- source priority
- date consistency

## Deterministic validations

- Input IDs and schema versions are present.
- Output validates against the declared JSON schema.
- Source and passage references resolve.
- Observation dates satisfy the temporal policy.
- Original model output and any repair record are preserved.

## Failure modes

- Missing source coverage.
- Invalid or ambiguous dates.
- Unsupported entity or measurement claim.
- Model output that violates schema or evidence requirements.
- Duplicate or conflicting records.

Failures must be emitted to a versioned error table rather than silently skipped.

## Evaluation

Use dedicated gold, adversarial, and regression fixtures. Report precision/recall where a gold set exists, evidence validity, unknown rate, and error taxonomy.

## Acceptance criteria

- No silent deletion
- Duplicate decision is reversible

## Run manifest

Every run records code commit, spec version, schema hash, prompt hash, model route, source-manifest hash, timestamps, retry count, and exclusions.

## Open questions

To be resolved during the sentinel pilot and documented in `docs/DECISION_LOG.md`.
